# captcha_using_python

In everyday internet usage we sometimes run across some captcha.

Captha are nothing but an verification method which can detect if the operations are being done by a human or a bot.

So the process in captha is the server generates new set of words and we have to type them dowm just to test the accuracy.

captcha can be of many types for example image,audio,puzzle,visual detection,finding a certain object etc.

In this repo we are going to use a python module to design a custom captcha maker.
Don't get your hopes high this isn't any fancy object detection captcha but just plain ordinary image recognition captcha.
